This is a Corona year.
So everything is kind of fluid, I guess.
Still, some basic information.

The course is based on the book
	[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by 
	[Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) and
	[Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/).
Note the book is freely available, chapter by chapter,
	on the above linked site.
You can buy a copy for a very modest price.
There are several copies in the library.

We will use slides which 
	[Moshe Sulamy](https://www.cs.mta.ac.il/staff/Moshe/mePublished_year_en.html) was kind enough
	to develop.
