## 2020-1A Introduction to Operating Systems

This is a Corona year.
So everything is kind of fluid, I guess.
Still, some basic information.

The course is based on the book
	[Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) by 
	[Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/) and
	[Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/).
Note the book is freely available, chapter by chapter,
	on the first linked site.
A copy can be purchased for a very modest price,
	see the above link...
There are several copies in the library.


Grading. 70% final exam, 30% assignments.
The TA was, is, and hopefully will be,
	[Tzvi Melamed](http://tzvimelamed.com/lab/).

We will use slides prepared by
	[Moshe Sulamy:](https://www.cs.mta.ac.il/staff/Moshe/mePublished_year_en.html)
