<h2>(x86-32) Basic mmu doc</h2>

Register CR3 points to the active external table.
<canvas id= "cr3" width="1000" height="30">
</canvas>
The external table must be page aligned.
Loading of CR3 purges the TLB unless
	we have ASIDs in the TLB.
<br/>
An entry in the external table has the following format:
<canvas id="pde" width="1000" height="130">
</canvas>
For our purpose only the rightmost three bits 
	are	of importance.
In fact only the P bit is relevant
since e page size we use is always 4KB and both the U and R
bit are always one.
<br/>
The internal table entries are almost identical
	to the external table entries.
For our purpose the entries are identical.
<canvas id="pte" width="1000" height="130">
</canvas>
The same comment noted for the external page table entries
is also relevant here, i.e.,
 only the rightmost three bits 
	are	of importance.
In fact only the P bit is relevant
since e page size we use is always 4KB and both the U and R
bit are always one.
<br/>
The virtual address is considered to have three	
	fields as follows.
<canvas id="va" width="1000" height="130">
